# Trees: Is This a Binary Search Tree? 
 
For the purposes of this challenge, we define a binary search tree to be a binary tree with the following ordering properties:

The  value of every node in a node's left subtree is less than the data value of that node.
The  value of every node in a node's right subtree is greater than the data value of that node.
Given the root node of a binary tree, can you determine if it's also a binary search tree?

Note: We do not consider a binary tree to be a binary search tree if it contains duplicate values.

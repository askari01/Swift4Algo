# Coin Flipping and Die Rolls (Random Int using random bit generator) 
 
Describe an algorithm to output a die roll (a random number from 1 to 6), given a  function that outputs a coin toss (a random number from 1 to 2).  Each possible  outcome should be equally likely. 

Sample Answer: Flip the coin three times, and use the three coin flips as the bits of a  three‚Äêbit number.  If the number is in the range 1 to 6, output the number.   Otherwise, repeat.  Note that many other answers are possible.
